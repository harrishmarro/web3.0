Web3.0 Application Readme

This readme file provides an overview of the Web3.0 application that utilizes React and Solidity for Ethereum transactions. This application enables users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, perform transactions, and manage their Ether assets. Below you will find information on installation, features, and usage of the application.
Installation

To install and run the Web3.0 application, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository from GitHub:

   shell

    git clone https://github.com/harrishmarro/web3.0.git

Navigate to the project directory:

   shell

    cd web3-app

Install the necessary dependencies:

   shell

    npm install

Configure the Ethereum network and contract details:
    Open the config.js file in the project directory.
    Set the appropriate Ethereum network URL, such as an Infura endpoint.
    Provide the contract address and ABI (Application Binary Interface) for the Solidity contract you intend to interact with.

Start the development server:

   shell

    npm start

Access the application by opening a web browser and visiting http://localhost:3000.

Features
1. Ethereum Transaction

    Users can initiate Ethereum transactions directly from the application.
    Transactions can include sending Ether, interacting with smart contracts, and invoking specific contract functions.
    The application provides a user-friendly interface for inputting transaction details such as recipient address, amount, and gas price.

2. Wallet Integration

    Users can connect their Ethereum wallets (such as MetaMask) to the application.
    Wallet integration allows users to sign transactions securely using their private keys.
    The application retrieves the user's account address and balance, making it easier to manage Ether assets.

3. Transaction History

    The application maintains a transaction history, displaying a list of past transactions with relevant details.
    Users can review their transaction history to track the status and details of previous Ethereum transactions.

4. Contract Interaction

    Users can interact with specific Solidity contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.
    The application dynamically loads the contract ABI to provide an intuitive interface for invoking contract functions.
    Users can input function parameters and interact with contract methods directly from the application.

Usage

Connect your Ethereum wallet:
    Open the application in a web browser.
    Click on the "Connect Wallet" button.
    Follow the prompts to connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
    Once connected, your account address and Ether balance will be displayed.

Initiate an Ethereum transaction:
    Enter the recipient's Ethereum address.
    Specify the amount of Ether you want to send.
    Adjust the gas price (if desired).
    Click on the "Send Transaction" button to initiate the transaction.

Interact with a Solidity contract:
    Provide the contract address and ABI in the configuration.
    Navigate to the contract interaction section of the application.
    Select the desired contract method to interact with.
    Enter the required parameters.
    Click on the "Invoke Function" button to execute the contract function.

View transaction history:
    The transaction history section displays a list of previous transactions.
    Each transaction shows details such as the transaction hash, status, and timestamp.
    Clicking on a transaction can reveal additional information about the transaction.
